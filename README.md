Primary reasons for using FDTD
1) No Linear Algebra involved. 
2) Accurate and robust. Errors that occur in FDTD model are well understood and can be bounded to provide accurate results. 
3) Can calculate non linear behaviours very easily. 
4) Doesn't require calculation of any structure dependent Green's function.
5) Easy to visualise. 

ABCs in the FDTD method allows the waves to exit the domain with almost negligible reflections. 

Leapfrog method is used. 
Very friendly to parallel computing.
