# ðŸš€ 1D FDTD Simulations  

This repository contains **1D Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD)** simulations for solving **Maxwellâ€™s equations**. Starting from the basics, we progressively build towards advanced absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs) and Perfectly Matched Layers (PMLs).  

---

## ðŸ“– Background  
We solve the following Maxwellâ€™s curl equations:  

\[
\frac{\partial H_z}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \frac{\partial E_x}{\partial y}, \quad
\frac{\partial E_x}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \frac{\partial H_z}{\partial y}
\]

These are discretized using the **FDTD algorithm** and extended with absorbing boundaries step by step:  

1. **Mur ABC** â€“ Simple and effective for 1D.  
2. **Naive PML** â€“ Introduces absorption via constant conductivity.  
3. **Graded PML** â€“ Conductivity increases exponentially for better absorption.  
4. **CPML** â€“ Industry-standard, absorbs waves at any incident angle.  

All methods are based on **Allen Tafloveâ€™s FDTD book** and cross-referenced with **Joshua Baxter PhDâ€™s GitHub and YouTube resources**.

## ðŸ§ª Simulation Setup  
- **Excitation:** Sinusoidal signal wrapped in a Gaussian.  
- **Configuration:** Parameters are controlled via a `json` file.  
- **Examples:** A sample test case is provided in the `test/` directory.

- `01_fdtd_abc.cpp` â†’ Mur ABC implementation.  
- `02_fdtd_naive_pml.cpp` â†’ Naive PML.  
- `03_fdtd_graded_pml.cpp` â†’ Graded PML.  
- `04_fdtd_cpml.cpp` â†’ Convolutional PML (CPML).

## ðŸŒŸ Why This Progression?  
- **Mur ABC** is perfect for 1D but fails in higher dimensions.  
- **Naive PML** shows absorption but with reflections.  
- **Graded PML** removes reflections in 1D but fails for angled incidence.  
- **CPML** solves it allâ€”robust across dimensions and angles.
